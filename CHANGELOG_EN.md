[简体中文](CHANGELOG.md) | [English](CHANGELOG_EN.md)

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [2.0.1] - 2026-08-28

### Rights and clean-brand hardening

- Removed unnecessary third-party brand references from the READMEs, Skill
  workflow, code comments, and test names
- Retained all 60 inherited design-system presets, product demos, screenshots,
  theme previews, media, and finished PPTX examples while making clear that
  they are not any vendor's official or authorized templates
- Added focused provenance and usage notices for example media and presets;
  users must still confirm rights for independent commercial reuse or
  redistribution of third-party images, logos, fonts, and marks
- Added `TRADEMARKS.md`, `RIGHTS_POLICY.md`, and `PROVENANCE.md` to separate
  trademark boundaries, rights-holder notices, and necessary attribution
- Added rights checks for templates, logos, fonts, images, style transfer, and
  page-by-page replication to the Skill workflow

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-28

### Breaking changes

- Renamed the project, npm package, CLI, and Skill to `pptd-studio-skill`,
  `pptd-studio-skill`, `pptd-studio-skill`, and `pptd-studio`, respectively
- Moved the GitHub repository to `skystart233-code/pptd-studio-skill`
- New installation does not automatically delete the legacy `open-kimi-ppt`
  Skill directory

### Documentation and open-source compliance

- Rewrote the Chinese and English READMEs to document the Open-PPTD editor
  changes, template compatibility, animation boundary, installation status,
  security model, and migration path
- Preserved the original MIT copyright and added `NOTICE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `SECURITY.md`, and a third-party component inventory
- Added redistribution license texts for Open-PPTD, Apache ECharts, d3,
  js-yaml, KaTeX, and Bootstrap Icons; installed Skill copies retain the
  required notices

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-27

### Changed

- Replaced the default editor with the bundled Open-PPTD editor; the predecessor's hosted editor and static assets are no longer loaded
- Switched PPTX export to the local Open-PPTD OOXML writer, removing browser-download, agent-browser, and third-party-session dependencies
- Switched image QA to Open-PPTD's local headless renderer
- Retained the predecessor's design systems; version 2.0.1 adds clearer non-official wording and usage boundaries
- Legacy element-animation metadata survives edit/save round trips, but Open-PPTD currently exports static slides only; this boundary is documented and tested

### Security

- PPTD projects are no longer passed to a third-party web editor; only remote resources explicitly referenced by a deck may use the network

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- CLI supports `-h` / `--help` and `-V` / `--version`

### Changed

- Renamed the npm package and CLI from `open-kimi-ppt-skills` to `open-kimi-ppt-skill` to match the GitHub repo. Use `npx open-kimi-ppt-skill@latest` going forward; the old package name will no longer receive updates

## [1.1.3] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Interactive `install` checklist for `.agents` / `.codex` / `.claude` / `.cursor` / `.workbuddy` skill directories (space to multi-select)
- `-y/--yes` (non-interactive default) and repeatable `--target`
- `--all` installs only into detected agent directories; missing agents are skipped with a notice instead of being created
- Windows export auto-starts a persistent debug browser (Chrome, falling back to Edge) to work around agent-browser failing to launch Chrome itself; the instance stays resident and is reused across exports, and `AGENT_BROWSER_CDP` can point to a debug browser you started yourself

### Fixed

- Tolerate files vanishing mid-scan in `find_download` when Chrome renames `.crdownload` entries in Downloads, avoiding `FileNotFoundError` aborting export (Related to #4)

### Changed

- README now steers agents to `npx open-kimi-ppt-skill@latest install -y` instead of cloning the repo

## [1.1.2] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Fix Chinese-locale Windows export hang / GBK decode errors in `export_pptx.py` / `export_images.py` (capture stdout via temp file + UTF-8)
- Work around agent-browser `--download-path` silently canceling Chrome downloads: click download and poll the default Downloads folder
- Stop shipping `__pycache__/*.pyc` in the npm package (list script sources explicitly in `files`)

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Align PPTD with official element-level `animations`; Skill notes for animation / `notes` usage bounds
- Align image priority, anti-AI copy rules, clarification asks, replicate guidance, and parallel page writes
- Ship ~30 preset design systems, invoked only when named
- Restore `customFonts` (Google Fonts) and poster size recommendations
- Root theme catalogs: `theme.md` / `theme_EN.md` (with preview images)
- Sample project `example/xiaomi-yu7-ppt-animation` (on-slide entrance animations)

### Changed

- Sync scenario docs with official animation guidance and `customFonts` references
- README: document element animations, preset themes, and sample prompts

## [1.0.2] - 2026-08-06

### Changed

- `install` overwrites an existing skill by default; `--force` is no longer required (still accepted for compatibility)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Skill workflow **step0 prerequisite check**: verify Node.js 18+, npm/npx, and python3 before generation; note that a Chromium-based browser is required for export
- Export scripts check **Node.js 18+** and **npm** at startup, with clear install guidance when missing or too old
- CLI (`open-kimi-ppt-skill`) refuses to start when the Node.js major version is below 18
- Auto-install **PyYAML** via `pip install --user pyyaml` when missing (same pattern as Pillow / websocket-client)

### Docs

- Added multi-agent / multi-model example screenshots (ChatGPT·Codex + 5.6 Luna, Reasonix + DeepSeek, WorkBuddy, and more)
- Clarified install as “automatic or manual — pick one”, with Windows path notes
- Updated README structure and example images

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Initial release of `open-kimi-ppt-skill`
- PPTD create / edit / replicate, delivering both an editable PPTD project and a PPTX by default
- Browser-side PPTX export (embedded fonts, fade transitions) with optional multimodal visual QA before export
- Local in-browser PPTD editor (`npx open-kimi-ppt-skill serve`)
- CLI to install the skill into `~/.agents/skills` (or another agent directory via `--target`)
